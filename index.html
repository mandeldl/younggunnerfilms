		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Young Gunner Films is a film development and production company founded by <a href="#noah">Noah Lang</a>, <a href="#david">David Mandel</a> and <a href="#james">James Morrison</a>.  We're taking a lean, balanced approach to filmmaking that adapts the best ideas and practices from the tech startup world.  We've seen (and worked for) many film companies that collapsed under old models of development, so we're going to build something new and sustainable.</p>
		<p>We're storytellers first, and believe there are and always will be audiences for quality films.  Our ambition is to develop our audiences alongside our projects.  As producers, we are responsible to them as well as to our artists and our investors.</p>
		<p>We currently have a slate of micro- to low-budget films.  First up is an ambitious feature drama with a heavy sci-fi element.  Think BLUE VALENTINE, but across parallel universes.  We're also working on a feature narrative set inside the world of underground boxing and a contained thriller set in a world coming to grips with an unknown contagion outbreak.</p>
		<p>Thanks for stopping by, and do feel free to <a href="#CONTACT">drop us a line.</a></p>

		<h2>Noah Lang</h2>
		<!-- Photo of Noah? -->
		<p>Noah is a producer and writer based out of Brooklyn, NY. He recently worked in talent management, single picture finance, and advisory services at Cinetic Media. While at Cinetic, Noah closed the finance on Will Slocombe's COLD TURKEY (produced by David), worked with the finance team on John Turturro's FADING GIGOLO starring Woody Allen, as well as several other upcoming co-productions. As a consultant, he worked with companies such as Big Beach Films, and No Mystery Studios. He also facilitated the signing of several titles for FilmBuff including the iTunes hits OCCUPATION: FIGHTER, BEAUTY DAY and THE NAKED BRAND. Noah has a BA in Film and Media from Swarthmore College and has done additional coursework through the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand where he did a work study program with Peter Jackson's Weta Digital. He recently co-produced a modern adaptation of W.W. Jacobs' THE MONKEY'S PAW, and the motion capture animated short THE WHEATFIELD (Berkshire International Film Festival, Monadnock International Film Festival, Manhattan Film Festival) and is executive producing the documentaries 52: THE SEARCH FOR THE LONELIEST WHALE IN THE WORLD and HEAVEN ADORES YOU: AN ELLIOTT SMITH PROJECT (San Francisco International Film Festival, Canadian Music Week Film and Music Festival) as well as the upcoming SUN BELT EXPRESS which took the top prize at the US in Progress program in Wroclaw, Poland this fall, was a Cine Qua Non Writers Lab selection last year, and will premiere at the Champs Elysees Film Festival this June.</p>
		<p>Noah's role is both creative and packaging oriented, with an eye towards helping attach talent above and below the line and continuing to build strong relationships with our vendors, financiers, and facilities.  More than anything else, Noah is driven to attracting audiences and talent alike in the pursuit of creating compelling content. He is currently writing a surrealist revenge thriller set in the unsanctioned barenuckle boxing scene of the American southwest and is wrapping up producing duties on DIVERGE with Young Gunner Films</p>

		<h2>David Mandel</h2>
		<!-- Photo of David -->
		<p>David is a creative producer who has worked on shorts and features with budgets ranging from $1,000 to $12Million. He's seen it all, but is too modest to say so. While he loves the creative aspect and has been repeatedly told he gives the best script notes in the business, he isn't afraid to get his hands dirty - he has been a physical producer and/or worked day-to-day set operations on every project on his IMDB page. He and James met 5 years ago on the set of RAGE, where they decided to team up for some shorts (David producing, James directing). The results have toured the country on the festival circuit, and their respective independent filmmaking careers were born. David and Noah met a year ago while David was searching for financing for his latest feature, COLD TURKEY. Noah saved the project from oblivion, and David has sworn fealty to him ever since.</p>
		<p>David's role will encompass both the creative - developing scripts and helping to package and market them; as well as the physical - line-producing, creating schedules and budgets for projects as well as helping to run the day-to-day operations/accounting of the business.</p>
		<p>More than anything else, David is motivated by a strong desire to fix what's wrong in the film industry - not just for himself and his team, but for generations of filmmakers to come.</p>
